# Project Overview: TravelGenie AI-Powered Itinerary Builder

## 1. High-Level Architecture
- **Full-stack web app** for AI-powered travel planning, focused on India.
- **Frontend:** React (with React Router, React Query, custom UI components).
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express, Supabase for persistent storage/auth, Gemini LLM for itinerary generation.

## 2. Frontend Flow
- **Entry Point:** `App.tsx` sets up providers (React Query, Auth, Tooltip) and routes.
- **Main Pages:**
  - `/` (LandingPage): Marketing, onboarding, and feature highlights.
  - `/index`: Main itinerary builder (protected). Users fill a form (destination, dates, style, budget, pace, special requests, accessibility) and submit to generate an itinerary.
  - `/saved-plans`: Authenticated users view/search/filter/manage saved itineraries.
  - `/share/:shareId`: Publicly viewable shared itineraries.
  - `/login`, `/signup`, `/auth/verify`: Auth and onboarding flows.
- **Auth:** Managed via context (`AuthContext.tsx`), JWT tokens in localStorage, hooks for authenticated fetches.
- **UI:** Modern, responsive, interactive, with loading/error states and toast notifications.

## 3. Backend Flow
- **API Endpoints:**
  - **Auth:** Signup, login, magic link, verify, logout, refresh, get current user.
  - **Itinerary:** `/api/generate-itinerary` (LLM-powered), save/update/delete/share itineraries, export as PDF, feedback.
- **Itinerary Generation:**
  - Uses Gemini LLM with a strict prompt for valid JSON output.
  - Validates and auto-fixes LLM output.
  - Rate-limited and cached for efficiency.
- **Persistence:** Supabase for users/itineraries, with in-memory fallback for dev.

## 4. Key Features
- **AI-powered, customizable itinerary generation** (destination, dates, style, budget, pace, special requests, accessibility).
- **User accounts** with JWT-based auth.
- **Save, edit, delete, and share itineraries** (public/private).
- **Export itineraries as PDF.**
- **Feedback system** for improvement.
- **Modern, responsive UI** with clear error/loading states.

## 5. Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, React Query, custom UI, Sonner/Toaster for notifications.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Supabase, JWT, bcrypt, Gemini LLM API.
- **Other:** TypeScript, environment-based config, modular code structure.
